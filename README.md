# BDKpex - A YANHAX private (used to be) kernel driver

Yes, I'm making this public so I can put this on my CV, talk about sacrifices.

Kernel physical memory Read/Write no attach. Double data pointer communication without directly chaning, DKOM clears all traces, no system threads, hijacked usermode threads.

A simple implementation on Apex as proof of concept, Undetected Since Nov 2021

I didn't remove my function signatures, please don't steal them and sell them, oh actually, I should go remove them right now... Here's some video I made in 2022, enjoy!
