# BDKpex - A YANHAX private (used to be) kernel driver

Sometimes I think I'm stuck in the past. I was really proud of this, but now I guess it's time to let it go, we always gotta go forwards aye? I will get new hobbies, meet new people, do new stuff, doesn't that sound fun :)

Kernel physical memory Read/Write no attach. Double data pointer communication without directly chaning, DKOM clears all traces, no system threads, hijacked usermode threads.

A simple implementation on Apex as proof of concept, Undetected Since Nov 2021
